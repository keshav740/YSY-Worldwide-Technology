              At YSY Worldwide TECHNOLOGY, we understand the intricacies of
              Country by Country (CbC) Reporting, a pivotal aspect of the Base
              Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative led by the
              Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
              the Group of Twenty (G20) industrialized nations. CbC Reporting is
              an essential regulatory requirement for large Multinational Groups
              of Entities (MNEs) operating in the UAE. We offer comprehensive
              services to ensure your compliance with CbC Reporting legislation
