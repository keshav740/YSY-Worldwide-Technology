            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
              The Economic Substance Regulations are an initiative by the
              Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
              aimed at countering artificial and harmful profit shifting
              practices. These regulations are implemented to ensure that
              companies with operations in low-tax jurisdictions, including the
              UAE, engage in real economic activities in the jurisdictions where
              they are established.

              corporate tax systems.
